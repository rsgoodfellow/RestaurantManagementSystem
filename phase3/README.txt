Ensure that the database has already been created and the it has been named: "RestaurantManagmentSystem"

On the first line below the program class opening:

"static string connectionString = "Server=DESKTOP-0LUMDSN;Database=RestaurantManagementSystem;Trusted_Connection=True;";"

Replace "DESKTOP-0LUMDSN" to whatever server connection you're using for the database.

Reminder:

Please ensure the database is called "RestaurantManagmentSystem", otherwise it won't work. If you've already made the database with a diffrent name
	please change the calling method to your database name in the connectingString.
